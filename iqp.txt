The Interactive Qualifying Project is a social- science research project at WPI completed during junior year which connects STEM subjects to societal issues. 
The project team I worked with was tasked with creating a "passive data collection" plan to synthesize customer feedback for the United States Patent and Trademarks Office. This plan outlined ways the USPTO could collect customer satisfaction data passively and methods that could be used to interpret the data collected.  We worked with the office of Patent Quality Assurance to determine what ethical and legal practices should be followed,  and presented them with an outline of a data collection plan, a literature review of prior research and best practices and next steps for moving forward.
Below are some of the deliverables we presented with our final paper. You can read more about this project and the final paper by clicking the button above. It will lead you to WPI's project database.
